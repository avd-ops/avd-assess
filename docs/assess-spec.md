# Spec: avd-assess, a research index for AVD assessment

> **Moved from [avd-second-brain](https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-second-brain)** (`docs/assess-spec.md` at commit `38033b9`), where it was written, to the repo it designs ([avd-second-brain decision 0024](https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-second-brain/pull/59)). Links to the brain point at its `main` branch. Only the links and the non-ASCII characters (this repo's check refuses them) changed. Section 8 still shows the brain holding the schemas; decision 0021 moved them here.


- **Status:** Phases 0 to 3 built: this spec, the avd-assess seed, the C19 to C21 schemas and checks here (section 7), and avd-assess's first `method.json`. Phases 4 to 6 are not built.
- **Owner's direction (2026-10-20):** `avd-assess` gets its own public MIT repo. It holds methodology only: collection, assessment, and target, benchmark and scoring. It is a **research project**. It doesn't reinvent anything that already exists. It links out to existing sources with immutable references and adds value by validating them against our own experience and observations. It writes new method only where nothing exists.
- **Date:** 2026-10-20
- **Builds on:** [decision 0005](https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-second-brain/blob/main/docs/knowledge/decisions/0005-one-schema-registry-and-fact-register.md) (one schema registry and fact register), [decision 0011](https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-second-brain/blob/main/docs/knowledge/decisions/0011-family-format-upstream-sources.md) (link upstream, don't restate), [decision 0018](https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-second-brain/pull/41) (proposed: the public family ends at its contracts), and contracts C11, C14, C15 and C17 in [contracts.md](https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-second-brain/blob/main/docs/contracts.md).

- **Roles (owner, 2026-10-20):** avd-landing-zone is how the estate is built and changed from here; avd-current-state is what is there now; avd-assess is what it should be, and why.

## 0. Status (2026-10-21) and the map

This spec was written before the repo existed and describes the plan of 2026-10-20. The repo has moved past it: eleven method pages instead of four (section 3a), the five stages with contracts C19 to C24, a dimension register, baselines, a use case library, a gold-standard registry and an evidence intake. Sections 3a, 8 and 9 are history; the contracts moved here (decision 0021). What governs the repo now is the **map**, from the owner's rule of 2026-10-21: avd-assess is not a shadow source of information. Where an upstream source exists, link to it, pinned, and restate nothing. What this repo must hold is the map of every detail an AVD estate is built and assessed by.

**The node.** One row in `dimensions.yaml` per detail, in one pillar of `pillars.yaml`: what it decides; its upstream claims (`ref:`, with standing `published`, `prior` or `guidance`), our observations (`obs:`) or the gap page (`gap:`) when no source covers it; the facts that measure it (register IDs, each `built`, `specified` or `proposed:`); the checks that judge it; the C14 decision it moves; and the landing zone parameters that set it, or `none` with a reason. `measure` says what kind of read it needs: a control-plane fact, the private rebuild package, a measurement, the operator's intake, a host-side read, a directory read, or none.

**Three states, reported per pillar.** A node is *mapped* when it has a pin or a gap page (`tests/check_dimensions.py` enforces it). It is *measurable* when its facts are built and a check exists. It is *validated* when an observation with evidence backs its claim, or an evidence file fills its baseline. `map.json` (contract C20, `avd-assess-map/v1`) publishes the map for readers such as the standards library.

**Pins.** A GitHub source pins to a commit. A Learn page pins by its own `git_commit_id` and `updated_at`; because the source repository behind most Learn pages is private, that identifies the version but can't be opened, so a reference may also carry `archive:`, an archived snapshot taken on the read date. The weekly `pins` workflow reports drift (Learn commits moved, GitHub paths gone, landing zone parameters and checklist items with no row) in one issue; a pin moves only by a reviewed pull request.

**Where the work stands.** [pillars.yaml](../pillars.yaml) lists the 21 pillars with a status each, and `tests/check_dimensions.py` prints the pillars that have no rows yet. The order of work, from the owner's review of 2026-10-21: the map plumbing (this section, `pillars.yaml`, `map.json`, the pins workflow, the wording test), then phase 4 in avd-current-state (something that runs `method.json`), then one pull request per pillar that pins its checklist items and adds its rows, then the first evidence file from a sandbox run.

## 1. Summary

The world has already written most of what it takes to assess an AVD estate. Microsoft's review checklist, its resiliency library and WARA, the Well-Architected checklists, the session host sizing guidelines, the connection quality guidance and the Windows optimization tool are all published. What's missing is a place that gathers those sources, says which ones hold up in practice, and fills the few real gaps. avd-assess is that place. It has three layers, and only the last two are ours:

1. **References (theirs).** An index of every source the method relies on. Each entry has a pinned, immutable link, so a reader can see exactly what the source said on the day we read it, plus the claims we take from it (an ID, a number, a recommendation) in a short line of our own words. The source's text is never copied.
2. **Observations (ours).** What our own runs showed about each claim: whether it agrees, disagrees, extends the claim or is not yet tested, with links to the evidence. Evidence is a landing zone lesson, a run record (C17), a validator result or a KB page. This is the research and the value add.
3. **Gaps (ours, marked as such).** Method written only where no source exists: joining recommendations to the family's redacted facts, the decision-readiness rules for the target state, and a scoring model, because no open scoring standard exists (section 3). Each gap entry says what we searched for and didn't find, so it can be replaced the day a source appears.

Those layers serve one purpose: avd-assess is **the family's starting point and reference for four methodologies**, each a page a person reads first (section 3a):

- **Collection:** what to collect about an estate, from where, and with what privacy class.
- **Assessment:** how to judge what was collected against the recommendations.
- **Targets and benchmarks:** what good looks like, as numbers with their sources.
- **Scoring:** how outcomes roll up, and which decisions the evidence can support.

Each page states the method in order, step by step. Every step links the reference it comes from, the observations that test it, or the gap entry where we wrote it ourselves.

avd-assess has no tools. avd-current-state implements the collection and assessment it describes. avd-second-brain ingests it, and the brain's agents cite it. Both read a pinned copy (section 8).

## 2. What exists today and what is missing

| Intake (what telemetry can't know) | **Missing:** five `intake.*` facts with no contract | section 6.2 |
| The fact-to-recommendation mapping, decision readiness and scoring | **Missing**; no source covers them | section 6 |

## 3. Sources found so far

Searched 2026-10-20. Sources were Microsoft Learn (through the Learn MCP search), the web, the PowerShell Gallery, the upstream repos' own pages, the family's prior-art report and adoption spec, and the family KB (`scripts/kb/prior_art.py`). GitHub's search API and the sibling KBs returned HTTP 403 from the build container. GitHub was therefore checked repo by repo, not searched broadly. A broad search is the first step of phase 1 (section 10).

Not found: an open scoring model for an AVD estate, a published logon-time target, or a mapping from the review checklist to evidence. Those are the gaps (section 6).

## 3a. The four methodology pages (`methods/`)

`methods/collection.md`, `methods/assessment.md`, `methods/targets-benchmarks.md` and `methods/scoring.md` are the front door. Anyone starting an assessment, and any family repo implementing one, starts here. Each page:

1. states the method as numbered steps, in the order someone would do them;
2. gives each step its basis: a reference claim (`ref:...#...`), an observation, or a gap entry;
3. ends with what is still unknown or untested, linked to the open observations.

A page never says more than its references, observations and gaps support. A test checks that every step cites at least one of them. Changing a step means changing what it cites first, so the pages stay a view over the evidence rather than a second source. Version 1 of each page is written in phase 1 (section 10) from the sources in section 3, before any tooling.

## 4. References: the index (`references/`)

One YAML file per source, with an ID that observations and docs can cite (and that a vault can use as a wikilink, `[[ref:review-checklists-avd]]`):

```yaml
id: ref:session-host-sizing
title: Session host virtual machine sizing guidelines
url: https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/session-host-virtual-machine-sizing-guidelines
pin:
  repo: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windowsserverdocs
  path: WindowsServerDocs/remote/remote-desktop-services/session-host-virtual-machine-sizing-guidelines.md
  commit: <sha>
read: 2026-10-20
license: Learn content (link only)
claims:
  - id: medium-users-per-vcpu
    says: Multi-session medium workloads, at most 4 users per vCPU
    kind: prior        # published | prior (the source calls it an estimate) | guidance
    anchor: "#workloads"
```

- **Immutable links.** A GitHub source is pinned to a commit (`/blob/<sha>/...`). A Learn page is pinned to its source file at a commit in Microsoft's public docs repo, beside the readable URL. A source with neither gets an archived copy's URL and the date it was read. The readable URL can move; the pin can't.
- **Claims, not content.** A claim is an ID and one line in our words, with the source's anchor. The source's text is never stored.
- **Freshness.** A scheduled check compares each pin to the source's current head. When the source changes, it opens an issue naming the claims to re-read. Nothing changes silently: a claim moves to a newer pin only by a reviewed PR.

## 5. Observations: our evidence (`observations/`)

One entry per claim we have evidence about:

```yaml
claim: ref:session-host-sizing#medium-users-per-vcpu
verdict: not-yet-tested   # agrees | disagrees | extends | not-yet-tested
evidence: []              # links: a lesson, a run record (C17), a validator result, a KB page
observed: null            # one line, our words, no estate data
date: 2026-10-20
```

- Evidence is a public link to a family artifact: a landing zone lesson, a run record, a KB page or a validator check. It holds no estate or customer data, the same rule as the KB. A measured result from a real estate reaches an observation only as a generalized, harvested fact (C2/C3), never as raw data.
- `disagrees` is the most valuable verdict. Each one also gets an upstream entry in this repo's KB (decision 0011), so a person can offer it back to the source.
- The first entries come from what already happened. For example, landing zone lesson 0028 (SMB channel encryption and FSLogix under Entra Kerberos) extends Microsoft's FSLogix storage guidance. The landing zone's WDOT review records which WDOT items we kept off and why.

## 6. Gaps: method we write (`gaps/`)

Each gap file opens with what was searched and not found, and is retired the day a source covers it.

### 6.1 Collection: facts to sources

For each fact ID in the register (C15), the Resource Graph table and property (`DesktopVirtualizationResources`, `Resources`) or the REST call, the WARA output field, the Insights table, or the intake question it comes from, and its privacy class. avd-current-state's collector is moving to these Resource Graph reads (adoption spec, section 6), with C11 unchanged. Each row cites the reference that documents the property, so the gap is only the join. Found while writing it: only session hosts are in `DesktopVirtualizationResources`; host pools, application groups, workspaces and scaling plans are in `Resources`, and policy assignments in `PolicyResources` (avd-assess `references/resource-graph-tables.yaml`). The rows carry the ARM resource type as well as the table.

### 6.2 Intake (`avd-intake/v1`, contract C19)

The operator answers these once per estate, in an `intake.json` file beside their landing zone parameters. The schema lives in this repo and gives the register's five `intake.*` facts their paths: `/residency`, `/preferredRegions`, `/existingHub` (`none`, `azure-hub`, `vwan`, `other`), `/identityConstraints` (`entra-only`, `hybrid-ad`, `entra-ds`, `undecided`) and `/workingHours`. Each question links the reference that explains why it matters. The schema has no field for a name, a domain, an address, an ID or free text.

### 6.3 Checks: claims to facts

A check is a declarative test of one or more claims against facts. It has a JSON pointer, a filter and an expectation, with no code:

```json
{ "id": "asm-personal-start-vm-on-connect", "title": "Personal host pools use Start VM on Connect",
  "pillar": "cost", "severity": "low", "claims": ["ref:review-checklists-avd#E01.05"],
  "facts": ["c11.hostPool.type", "c11.hostPool.startVmOnConnect"],
  "rule": { "each": "/subscriptions/*/hostPools/*", "where": { "type": { "eq": "Personal" } },
            "expect": { "startVmOnConnect": { "eq": true } }, "onFail": "warn" },
  "informs": ["hostPool.power"] }
```

There are four outcomes: `pass`, `warn` (a trade-off to review), `gap` and `unknown`. Unknown is never guessed, and a model never decides an outcome. A missing property makes a subject `unknown`, and a check's outcome is its subjects' worst (`gap`, `warn`, `unknown`, `pass`). Every cited fact must be `built` in the register, every claim must exist in `references/`, and every `informs` value must be a register decision (`Test-AssessMethod`). Version 1 has four checks that run on today's facts (Start VM on Connect for personal pools, two hosts per pooled pool, a private endpoint and zone-redundant storage for premium files). avd-assess's checklist mapping lists the other items with the fact or rule-language feature each needs (a join across subjects, an "any"), as the to-do for C11 and C20. Version 2 adds four security checks on new C11 facts (Trusted launch, drive and USB redirection, Defender's Servers plan, SMB channel encryption on premium files; avd-assess `methods/security.md`). Image checks cite the WDOT reference and stay `unknown` until a host fact exists.

### 6.4 Decision readiness and target-state rules

For each of the 10 C14 decisions, the claims and facts that decide it, and its readiness: `decidable`, `decidable with intake` or `needs measurement`. This generalizes today's coverage line. Sizing decisions cite the sizing guidelines' `prior` claims and stay `needs measurement`. Measuring real users is outside the family (decision 0018), so the method links avd-ops.dev there.

### 6.5 Scoring

No open standard exists, so the method publishes a simple one, labeled as a research hypothesis:

- the pillar score is the passing severity weight over the assessed weight (`warn` counts half; weights 3, 2 and 1, versioned);
- coverage, the share of a pillar's checks that aren't `unknown`, is always shown beside the score;
- there is no single overall number in version 1.

Observations test the model like any other claim: if a high score keeps coming with real problems, that becomes a `disagrees` entry on our own method.

## 7. Contracts

Built in phase 2, with examples in `contracts/examples/assess/` and tests in `tests/Connectors.Tests.ps1`. The details are in [contracts.md](https://github.com/nickprignano/avd-second-brain/blob/main/docs/contracts.md#c19-avd-intakev1).

- **C19 `avd-intake/v1`** (`intake.schema.json`): section 6.2. The five `intake.*` facts are now `built`, at those paths.
- **C20** is two documents, so no reader needs a YAML parser: `avd-assess-index/v1` (`assess-index.schema.json`), the references, observations and gaps that avd-assess generates as `index.json`, and `avd-assess-method/v1` (`assess-method.schema.json`), the `method.json` that holds the collection map, checks, readiness and scoring. `Test-AssessMethod` checks both against the register.
- **C21 `avd-assessment/v1`** (`assessment.schema.json`): the report avd-current-state writes. It records the method's version and commit, the snapshot time and estate pseudonym, one row per check (outcome, pseudonyms, fact IDs, claims), and the pillar scores with coverage and decision readiness. It holds no names, IDs or free text and passes the same guard as C11. `Test-AssessmentReport` checks a report against its method, and `Get-AssessScore` recomputes the pillars.

## 8. Who implements it, and how copies stay in sync

```
              avd-second-brain   schemas C11, C14, C15, C17, C19, C20, C21; fact register
                ^            ^
   pins schemas |            | pins the method; Test-AssessMethod; agents cite references and observations
                |            |
            avd-assess ------+   references, observations, gaps (source of truth)
                |
   vendored,    v byte-identical at a pinned commit
            avd-current-state    implements collection + assessment; writes C21
                .
            avd-landing-zone     unchanged; its lessons and run records are evidence avd-assess links to
```

- **avd-current-state** vendors `method.json` (the collection map, checks, readiness and scoring of the gap files) into `assess/`, byte-identical at the commit in `assess/PINS.json`, with its SHA-256 that `tests/Facts.Tests.ps1` checks, as it already does for the brain's contracts. Nothing is fetched at run time. If avd-assess disappeared, avd-current-state would keep its last pinned copy, so the landing zone and avd-current-state pair stays self-contained. Its evaluator, `-Assess` and the WARA import live there. The WARA import is the family's one WARA reader, and avd-swarm's proposed chat review reuses it (a paired swarm change when that is built).
- **avd-second-brain** holds the schemas and `Test-AssessMethod`, with tests in `tests/Connectors.Tests.ps1`. It adds avd-assess to `sources/sources.json`, so agents cite `avd-assess@<commit>:references/...` and observations. The assessment topic page links the index instead of restating it. `knowledge/rules/workload-tiers.json` cites the sizing claims as its prior. Reports are filed in the estate vault beside their C11 snapshot.
- **avd-swarm:** nothing new in version 1. An outcome reaches a plan only through the C11 fact IDs it cites.
- **avd-landing-zone:** unchanged. avd-assess links to its lessons, run records and WDOT profile at pinned commits.

## 9. Repo layout and checks

```
avd-assess/
  README.md        notice; scope: a research index, methodology only; how to cite
  LICENSE          MIT
  methods/         the four methodology pages: collection, assessment, targets-benchmarks, scoring
  references/      one YAML per source, pinned, claims only
  observations/    our evidence per claim
  gaps/            collection map, intake, checks, readiness, scoring, each with "searched, not found"
  docs/            the method in prose, every claim linked to its reference
  tests/           schemas (from the brain at a pin); every claim, fact and pin resolves; leak guard
```

CI checks only the method. There are no scripts that touch Azure. A scheduled job checks pin freshness and opens issues; it never edits.

## 10. Build order

All offline. No cloud spend until phase 6, which waits on the owner's go and a cost estimate.

| Phase | Repo | What |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | this repo | This spec (draft PR) |
| 1 | avd-assess | A broad GitHub and Learn search outside the build container. Then the seed: README, LICENSE, CI, references for the sources in section 3 with pins, the four methodology pages (version 1), and the first observations from existing lessons |
| 2 | this repo | C19, C20 and C21 schemas, examples, `Test-AssessMethod`, `Test-AssessmentReport` (built) |
| 3 | avd-assess | Gap files, version 1: collection map, intake, checks, readiness, scoring, in `method.json` (built: 4 checks, 26 collection rows, 10 readiness rows) |
| 4 | avd-current-state | Vendor the gap files with `assess/PINS.json`; evaluator, `-Assess`, C21; WARA import; collector reads through Resource Graph |
| 5 | this repo | `sources.json` entry, report filing, topic page links, `workload-tiers.json` cites its prior |
| 6 | (owner's go) | One sandbox run, which becomes the first observations from a run made for avd-assess; teardown evidence |

## 11. Open questions

1. **Who writes a baseline manifest** from the readiness rules (avd-current-state, which moves it past read-only inventory, or a small writer here). It also needs two C14 changes: `producer.name` accepting it, and sizing fields that may be absent at `low-confidence`.
2. **Image evidence.** Whether WDOT state becomes a fact (a tag on the gallery image version, or a host-side read by the validator).
3. **One overall score.** Left out of version 1; the owner's call.
4. **The private feature register row** for the baseline writer still says undecided. This spec reads "free" as covering it.

Name check (2026-10-20): no `avd-assess` package on the PowerShell Gallery and no repository found by web search.
